# Reservoir Storage Dynamics and Water Value Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes hydroelectric storage and water values for the Tekapo reservoir and other connected reservoirs (Hawea, Taupo, and Pukaki) in New Zealand.

The goal is to explore the seasonal relationships between reservoir storage levels and Tekapo water values and present them with clear visualizations.

## Key Features
Calculates Total Other Storage (sum of Hawea, Taupo, and Pukaki).

Converts Week number → Week Start Date dynamically.

Assigns season labels to each week’s data.

Computes seasonal max storage and percentage levels.

Categorizes storage into: Very Low, Low, Medium, High, Very High.

Generates seasonal scatter plots for Tekapo storage vs water value.

Exports the cleaned dataset for further analysis.

## Tech Stack
Python 3.x

pandas – data manipulation

numpy – numerical computations

matplotlib & seaborn – visualization

datetime – date handling

openpyxl / xlrd – Excel file support

## Outputs

Cleaned Dataset :Cleaned_Hydroelectric_Data.csv
